Java fields are actually the data members inside a class. For instance, in a class representing Car, the Car class might contain the following fields:

topSpeed
totalSeats
fuelCapacity

public class Car {
  
  int  topSpeed;
  int  totalSeats;
  int  fuelCapacity;
  
}

Static field
A static field resides in a class. All the objects we create will share this field and its value.

class Car {

  // static fields
  static int topSpeed;
  static int maxCapacity;

}

Static fields reside in the class. We don’t need an instance of the class to access static fields. We can access the static fields of a class by just writing the class name before the field:

class Car {
    // static fields
    static int topSpeed = 100;
    static int maxCapacity = 4;  
}

class Demo {
    public static void main(String args[]){
    // Static fields are accessible in the main
    System.out.println(Car.topSpeed);
    System.out.println(Car.maxCapacity);   
  }
}

Non-static field
Non-static fields are located in the instances of the class. Each instance of the class can have its own values for these fields.
As non-static fields doesn’t reside in the class, So we need an instance of the class to access non-static fields.

class Car {
    // static fields
    int speed = 100;
    int capacity = 4;  
}

class Demo {
    public static void main(String args[]){
    Car obj1 = new Car();
    System.out.println(obj1.speed);
    System.out.println(obj1.capacity);   
  }
}

Final fields
A final field cannot have its value changed once it is assigned. We can make a field final by using the keyword final

class Car {
  // Final field of capacity = 4
  // Now Capacity can nerver be changed from 4
  // to some other value throught the program
  final int capacity = 4;

}
Car class has capacity equals to 4 which can’t be changed. If you try to do so, you will get a compilation error.

class Car {
  // Final variable capacity
  final int capacity = 4;
}

class Demo {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      Car car = new Car();
      car.capacity = 5; // Trying to change the capacity value
   }
}
